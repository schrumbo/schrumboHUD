# SchrumboHUD v1.0.4
- **fixed weird pixel issues on switches in the clickgui**
- **fixed color picker bug which led to the picking area to be 1 unit off**
- **moved opacity slider for all color options from separate slider to the color picker**

# Known issues
- **hud only being resizable on 1.21.5 -> disabled on the newer versions because of scaling issues with items**
